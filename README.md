# NLP Basics Notebook

## Overview
The `NLPBasics.ipynb` notebook provides an introduction to fundamental concepts and techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It covers essential preprocessing steps, demonstrates the use of NLP libraries, and includes practical examples for working with text data.

## Features
**Text Preprocessing**: Techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal.  
**Vectorization**: Demonstrates methods such as Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and word embeddings.  
**Basic NLP Tasks**: Includes examples of text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition (NER).  
**Visualization**: Explores tools for visualizing text data and model outputs.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher  
Jupyter Notebook environment  
Required libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, nltk, scikit-learn, spaCy, and other NLP-specific tools as used in the notebook.

## How to Use
Download the notebook and open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
Run each cell in sequence to execute the workflow and learn about various NLP techniques.  
Experiment with your own text datasets by replacing the sample data provided in the notebook.

## Customization
Replace the sample text data with your own data to explore different NLP applications.  
Extend the notebook by adding advanced NLP models, such as transformer-based architectures like BERT or GPT.  
Incorporate more datasets or tasks like machine translation or text summarization.

## Future Enhancements
Introduce a section on deep learning for NLP, including the use of RNNs and attention mechanisms.  
Add practical exercises for hands-on learning.  
Provide references to additional NLP resources and tools for further study.
